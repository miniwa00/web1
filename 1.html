Sometimes they taught me some life lessons and also made me feel regretful about my behavior.<br><br>Now I'll tell you about my best memories in my life that I've experienced. To start with, I've got an enjoyable memory to tell you about. At the age of 10, I was attending an elementary school in Busan.
    In school, I always waited for lunch time. My friends always gathered together after lunch and had a great time while talking and played games. Playing with them was so fun! They were great friends of mine. I can't never forget that cute memory I have.</p>
